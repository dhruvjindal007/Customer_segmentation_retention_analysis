# 📌 Business Problem

Retail businesses often spend the same marketing budget on every customer, even though customers have very different purchasing behaviors.

This project helps answer important business questions such as:

- Who are the most valuable customers?
- Which customers are likely to stop purchasing?
- Which customers deserve loyalty rewards?
- Which customers should receive retention campaigns?
- How can marketing resources be allocated more efficiently?

Using **RFM Analysis** and **K-Means Clustering**, customers are grouped into meaningful business segments that support data-driven decision making.

The dataset contains over **1 million retail transactions** from a UK-based online retailer.

### Main Features

- Invoice
- Customer ID
- Invoice Date

# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

The project includes detailed EDA to understand:

- Customer purchasing patterns
- Country-wise revenue
- Product popularity
- Monthly revenue trends
- Customer purchasing frequency
- Revenue distribution
- Business KPIs

---

# 🧠 Feature Engineering

Customer behavior was summarized using **RFM Analysis**.

### Recency

Days since the customer's last purchase.

### Frequency

Number of unique purchases made by the customer.

### Monetary

Total amount spent by the customer.

These three features were used as input for clustering.

---

# 🤖 Machine Learning

## Algorithm

- K-Means Clustering

## Data Preprocessing

- Missing value handling
- Duplicate removal
- Invalid transaction removal
- Log Transformation
- StandardScaler

## Model Selection

The optimal number of clusters was determined using:

- Elbow Method
- Silhouette Score

## Cluster → Segment Labeling

Cluster IDs produced by K-Means are arbitrary and can shift between runs or
after retraining. Rather than hardcoding a fixed mapping like
`{0: "Lost Customers", 1: "Regular Customers", ...}`, both the training
notebook and the dashboard compute the cluster → business-label mapping at
runtime from each cluster's RFM profile. This keeps segment labels correct
even if the underlying model is retrained on new data.

---

# 📈 Customer Segments

The model identifies four customer groups.

| Segment | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 👑 VIP Customers | High spending, frequent purchases, recently active |
| 🙂 Regular Customers | Consistent customers with moderate spending |
| ⚠️ At-Risk Customers | Previously valuable customers becoming inactive |
| 💤 Lost Customers | Long inactive customers with low spending |

---

# 📌 Key Results

- Processed over **1 million retail transactions**.
- Engineered **RFM features** for customer-level analysis.
- Segmented **5,878 customers** into four meaningful business groups.
- Identified high-value customers for loyalty programs.
- Identified at-risk customers for targeted retention campaigns.
- Built an interactive dashboard for business users.
- Enabled real-time customer segment prediction.

---

# 📊 Dashboard Features

---

# 📈 Business Recommendations

| Customer Segment | Recommended Business Action |
|------------------|-----------------------------|
| 👑 VIP Customers | Offer premium memberships, exclusive rewards, and early access to products. |
| 🙂 Regular Customers | Encourage repeat purchases using loyalty programs and personalized recommendations. |
| ⚠️ At-Risk Customers | Launch personalized retention campaigns and limited-time offers. |
| 💤 Lost Customers | Use win-back campaigns with promotional discounts or reduce marketing spend if inactive for long periods. |
